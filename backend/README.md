# Around the U.S. Back End  
  
## Back End Basics 

### Project 12 @ Practicum WebDev

We will begin to create the backend of our Around The US project, using Node.js.

Standard project structure, routing. JSON files to emulate a DB.
Some groundwork laid so that a future update will add auxilary js file with middleware to make everything cleaner and more succinct.

## Project 13 Updates

Replaced JSON emulation with a database (mongoDB).
Added multipe routes for added functionality: likes, patching user and posting cards.
Error handeling is incomplete, but will catch everything for the time being.
*mini update* error handeling now more robust.

Future update ought to move repeating error handeling to a seperate module for the sake of more concise code.
